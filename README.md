Shortest way to adopt Fury

This is an example of project definition for the [Fury](https://fury.build/) build tool. 

The complete definition is actually contained in the file [`layer.fury`](https://github.com/odisseus/incitement/blob/master/layer.fury).
This file is human-readable, but it shouldn't be edited directly, because whitespace characters are important.

In order to set up your own project using this project as a template, clone or download `layer.fury`, 
then execute `fury` commands to modify it according to your needs.
